            <p>
            Dune (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One) is a 2021 American epic
            science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve from a screenplay by
            Villeneuve, Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth. It is the first of a two-part
            adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, primarily covering the
            first half of the book. Set in the far future, the film follows Paul
            Atreides as his family, the noble House Atreides, is thrust into a war
            for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet Arrakis. The ensemble
            cast includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh
            Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson,
            Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster,
            Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem. The film is the
            second theatrical adaptation of Dune following David Lynch’s 1984
            film, which was a critical and commercial failure, and the third
            adaptation overall following both the David Lynch film and John
            Harrison’s 2000 miniseries. After an unsuccessful attempt by Paramount
            Pictures to produce a new adaptation,[5] Legendary Entertainment
            acquired the Dune film and TV rights in 2016, with Villeneuve signing
            on as director in February 2017. Production contracts were only
            secured for the first film, relying on its success before a second
            film would be greenlit after the first film’s release. Filming took
            place from March to July 2019 at locations including Budapest, Jordan,
            Norway, and Abu Dhabi.

            <h2 class="subheading">Plot</h2>
            <p>In the far future, Duke Leto of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and the only source of “spice”, a valuable substance that grants its users heightened vitality and consciousness. It is critical for faster-than-light interstellar travel, as it grants Spacing Guild Navigators the limited prescience for safely navigating interstellar space. Shaddam actually intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor’s Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, whose influence threatens Shaddam’s control. Leto is reluctant, but sees the advantages of controlling Arrakis and forming an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen. Leto’s concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, a secretive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of their centuries-long breeding program, the Bene Gesserit instructed Jessica to bear a daughter whose son would become a male Bene Gesserit called the Kwisatz Haderach, a messianic being with the clairvoyance necessary to guide humanity to a better future; instead, she bore a son, Paul. Throughout his life, Paul is trained by Leto’s aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, Suk doctor Wellington Yueh and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, while Jessica trains Paul in Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan that he is troubled by visions of the future. In response, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam visits Caladan and subjects Paul to a test to assess his impulse control, which he passes. Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to spare Paul and Jessica during his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.</p>
